I'm resubmitting this package with a hot-fix
for an issue that occurs when this package is
used with an older version of {rmarkdown}.
I inadvertently relied on behavior
introduced in the latest version of rmarkdown (2.9).
I apologize for missing the issue in testing
and for the small delay between submissions;
the issue is large enough to warrant
immediate attention.
